# General frame to answer questions

## Case Study Interview
We need to show that we have scientific method to solve a problem. 
- Fit the problem into a framework (how? pending)
- Scope of the problem
- List possible reasons which causes the issue
    - for example, our product convertion rate is lower than our competitior
    - UI difference?
    - Recommendation Model?
    - Advertisement?
    - Use some domain knowledge to exclude some options
- Based on the specific item, we conduct a hypothesis:
    - How to collect data to validate our hypothesis? (survey, A/B testing, etc.)
    - What metric do we need to measure? (adoption rate?)
    - How to decide if we would like to have this feature implementation (come up with a threshold? compare with similar feature metrics performance? benefit/cost ratio consideration?)
